4.1	About. The OriginTrail OriginTrail v6 Bounty Program is intended to catalyze the efforts of all Participants joining in with the development and testing activities of OriginTrail v6. 

4.2	How to  participate. In order to participate, the Participant will need to:

(a)	Join the bounty program through the https://bountyprogram.origintrail.io/ website by providing the following information

(i)	Email,

(ii)	GitHub username (optional),

(iii)	Address of the wallet used for the v6 node.

(b)	Option 1: 

(i)	Contribute to OriginTrail codebase. Three different contribution types will be considered:

(A)	Contributing code: this means creating plugins, tools, components, resolving existing issues, creating valuable PoC integrations, contributing to the test-suite etc, by providing new code to existing repositories (listed below)

(B)	Testing & reporting: such as documenting an (undiscovered) issue in detail & proposing solutions, providing improvement proposals for the APIs etc 

(C)	Documenting & clarifying: such as creating tutorials (confirmed as eligible by the core development team via Github issues), updating the documentation and non-code related content updates that are considered helpful

(c)	Option 2: 

(i)	Setup a v6 DKG testnet and/or mainnet (once available) node.

(ii)	Install the Telemetry plugin (once available). The Telemetry plugin will automatically publish node usage data to the DKG with a set frequency.

1.4.	All bounty program Participants are encouraged to be creative with testing out their v6 nodes as much as possible, as that will generate valuable usage data (i.e. the value of the submitted data will be assessed based on several factors including the amount, richness, uniqueness of submitted data and time period) and improve their ranking/score in the bounty scoreboard. Finally, the Participants' contributions will be scored and ranked in a publicly visible scoreboard.

4.3	TRAC rewards. A total Bounty Pool of 250.000 TRAC will be distributed to Participants according to their contributions, either for each Github contribution, or for Telemetry contributions by applying a curve function to reward the higher engaged (and ranked) Participants. Participants will be identified by their Node Identifiers or Github user names.
